Learning python-clojure
Cortex integrates tensor flow into clojure
Possible ideas
Evolving images
Does an image belong to a data set
Percent of confidence
Work on classifier in python and port over with cortex
Work on making images with lists
Writing evolutionary algorithm
Vs. evolving a classifier
Break into groups using different classifiers?
Important to get structure working
Stay as large group to break overhead
Gans
Look into research in the field and logistical implementation details
Research what has been done with Evolutionary Image Generation  
Research classical [GANS](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan)  
Look into frameworks for ML in Clojure / Porting ML into Clojure  
 Look into using different discriminators  
 results can inform what the classifiers are doing
