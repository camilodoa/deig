"Towards Automated Artificial Evolution for Computer-generated Images"

"In 1991, Sims presented a novel approach for combining genetic algorithms with
computer graphics (Sims, 1991). The system which Sims designed allows users to
evolve complex figures without concern for the mathematics used to generate the
images. The interface is simple: given a number of initially random figures, the users
select the two which are the most interesting. These figures are used as ‘parents’ to
produce a subsequent population of ‘offspring’. The offspring possess some attributes of both parent images. From the new population of images, two parents are selected, and the cycle continues..."

Sims utilized elitist selection, taking the top two "interesting" images and crossing them over to make offspring with mutated elements. 

Also created an image repository. If the diversity of the pixels/image(s) is very low, we can recall images from previous generations and cross them over with the parents of the newer generations.

Currently, my thoughts are that we run a similar breeding technique of selecting the most interesting images (fitness function pending) and crossing them over, while having a stash of images from previous generations to use if diversity dips below a certain threshold.

Group thoughts:
Instead of diversity scores leading to pulling images from the repository, we could have a  measure of change in error across generations. If we are at a standstill, we can use the image repository then.
